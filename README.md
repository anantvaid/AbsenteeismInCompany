# AbsenteeismInCompany
This is a Full data science project on Absenteeism in the company where an analysis is done on the explanatory variables and the Absenteeism Time in Hours.
This is my project based on predicting time of absence of an employee during the company hours. The absence hours are segregated into two categories.
We have 0 when we get absence hours lesser than 3 hours (Median of all the data) and 1 if it is greater than 3 hours.
Since there is only binary classification we use the very old and famous LOGISTIC REGRESSION.
We also analyse the final results based on the data using TABLEAU Desktop Services.
I would like to thank Udemy's Complete Data Science Bootcamp by 365 Careers to teach me various concepts and help me do this project.
